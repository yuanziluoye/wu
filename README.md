# wu (å‘œ~)

A minimal **W**atch **U**tility who can run and restart specified command in
response to file changes automatically.

This utility is intended to provide a tiny tool to automate the Edit-Build-Run
loop of development. Although it is quite similar to watch tasks of Grunt or Gulp,
`wu` is designed to be just a single command with simplest interfaces to work with.

# Install

To install `wu` from source code, you have to install Golang's tool chain first.
